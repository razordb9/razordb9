Hello, I'm Thomas and I do programming for fun/hobby.

Currently I work with Python and try to dive into Web development with Flask/Django.
I choosed this path because it is fun and you have to learn more then if I just learn Python itself.

You can reach me on Twitter @ThomasZaussnig or GitHub @razordb9
